# Spin!

![](/assets/images/spin!.png "Spinner")

## Background

My friends and I always have a hard time deciding... whether it be what to eat, what movie to watch or a simple answer to a yes or no question.

We have a website we liked that served the spinning wheel purpose but the site quickly started to become unusable due to ads.

That's where this project comes in. I took the features we all liked from the our old tool and built my own for us to use

## Tech Stack

I don't have much experience with front-end projects so I used Spin! as an opportunity to experiment and learn. Tech stack and tools used for this project include:

- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- NodeJS
- Vercel


## Features

- Up to 20 entries
- Shuffle entry positions
- Quick Yes/No filter
- Duplicate entries to maximize randomness
- White/Dark mode
